# Clojure API for Selenium-WebDriver #

This is a Clojure library for driving a web browser using Selenium-WebDriver as the backend. For more comprehensive documentation on all of clj-webdriver's features, read the [Github wiki](https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver/wiki). You can generate documentation locally with `lein doc` (API docs) or `lein marg` (annotated source).

## Usage ##

### Quickstart ###

Here's a complete example of how to log into Github, using the high-level Taxi API:

```clj
(use 'clj-webdriver.taxi)

;; Start up a browser
(set-driver! {:browser :firefox} "https://github.com")

(click "a[href*='login']")

(input-text "#login_field" "your-username")
(input-text "#password" "your-password")

(submit "#password")
(quit)
```

Forms can be filled out en masse using the `quick-fill-submit` function:

```clj
(quick-fill-submit {"#login_field" "your-username"}
                   {"#password" "your-password"}
                   {"#password" submit})
```

Please note that the high-level Taxi API is only available in the 0.6.0 release series.

## Documentation ##

For API documentation on the high-level Taxi API (shown above), please [see its wiki page](https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver/wiki/Introduction%3A-Taxi).

For reference documentation, run `lein doc` at the root of this repo. For annotated source documentation, run `lein marg`.

## Contributing ##

The `master` branch of clj-webdriver houses code intended for the next **minor-version release.** If you want to propose new features for the next release, you're welcome to fork, make a topic branch and issue a pull request against the `master` branch.

If you want to fix a bug in the **current release**, please pull against the appropriate branch for the current minor version, **0.6.x**.

## Running Tests ##

Follow these steps from the root of this project to run clj-webdriver's tests locally:

```bash
cp resources/properties-example.clj resources/properties.clj

# Now edit that `properties.clj` file according to your local setup

lein compile

./script/test all
```

Note that you can run subsets of the test suite with the `script/test` script as follows:

```
Usage: test {all|core|firefox|remote|saucelabs|taxi|window}
```

The `core` option runs tests against the core API's using Firefox and Chrome. The `remote` option runs tests for Grid and remote server/driver handling. The `taxi` option tests just the Taxi API. The `all` option runs through each of the other options once.

*Note:* If you just want to run the example app that clj-webdriver uses for its testing purposes, you can find the app [on Heroku](http://vast-brushlands-4998.herokuapp.com) or can run it locally as follows:

 * Open a terminal and run `lein repl` or `lein swank` at the root of this project
 * Evaluate `(use 'clj-webdriver.test.example-app.core 'ring.adapter.jetty)`
 * Evaluate `(defonce my-server (run-jetty #'routes {:port 5744, :join? false}))`, making sure to adjust the `test-port` in `test/clj_webdriver/test/core.clj` to whatever you use here.
