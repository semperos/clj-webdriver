;; # Clojure API for Selenium-WebDriver #
;;
;; WebDriver is a library that allows for easy manipulation of the Firefox,
;; Chrome, Safari and  Internet Explorer graphical browsers, as well as the
;; Java-based HtmlUnit headless browser.
;;
;; This library provides both a thin wrapper around WebDriver and a more
;; Clojure-friendly API for finding elements on the page and performing
;; actions on them. See the README for more details.
;;
;; Credits to mikitebeka's `webdriver-clj` project on Github for a starting-
;; point for this project and many of the low-level wrappers around the
;; WebDriver API.

  (alert-text [driver] "Get the text of the popup dialog's message")
  ;; (authenticate-using [driver username password] "Enter `username` and `password` into fields from a Basic Access Authentication popup dialog")
  (dismiss [driver] "Dismiss the dialog. Equivalent to pressing 'Cancel'"))

;; ### Finding Elements on Page ###
(defprotocol IFind
  "Functions used to locate elements on a given page"
  (find-element-by [this by] "Retrieve the element object of an element described by `by`, optionally limited to elements beneath a parent element (depends on dispatch). Prefer `find-element` to this function unless you know what you're doing.")
  (find-elements-by [this by] "Retrieve a seq of element objects described by `by`, optionally limited to elements beneath a parent element (depends on dispatch). Prefer `find-elements` to this function unless you know what you're doing.")
  (find-table-cell [driver table coordinates] "Given a `driver`, a `table` element, and a zero-based set of coordinates for row and column, return the table cell at those coordinates for the given table.")
  (find-table-row [driver table row-index] "Return all cells in the row of the given table element, `row-index` as a zero-based index of the target row.")
  (find-by-hierarchy [driver hierarchy-vector] "Given a Webdriver `driver` and a vector `hierarchy-vector`, return a sequence of the described elements in the hierarchy dictated by the order of elements in the `hierarchy-vector`.")
  (find-elements [this locator] "Find all elements that match the parameters supplied in the `attr-val` map. Also provides a shortcut to `find-by-hierarchy` if a vector is supplied instead of a map.")
  (find-element [this locator] "Call (first (find-elements args))"))

;; ### Acting on Elements ###

  (focus [element] "Apply focus to the given element")
  (html [element] "Retrieve the outer HTML of an element")
  (intersects? [element-a element-b] "Return true if `element-a` intersects with `element-b`. This mirrors the Selenium-WebDriver API method, but see the `intersect?` function to compare an element against multiple other elements for intersection.")
  (location-on-page [element] "Given an element object, return its absolute location as a map of its x/y coordinates with the top-left of the page as origin.")

    [this]
    [this element] "Drag and drop, either at the current mouse position or in the middle of a given `element`.")
